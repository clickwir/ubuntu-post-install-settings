Post install settings for Ubuntu installs

This is basically a combination of 2 other scripts, into my own script for running after an Ubuntu install.

# This script provides a basic way of configuring a single Ubuntu machine in accordance
# with the attached End User Device guidance. This script contains sugegstions only and
# should be customised for individual user needs. In particular it will likely not scale
# to large deployments; in those scenarios a purpose-built tool should handle the roll-
# out and deployment of these devices. SCM tools, preseed scripts and automated technology
# such as PXE boot scripts should be used instead.
